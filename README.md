# ðŸ’¸ Wallet Tracker

Wallet Tracker is a personal finance management web app built with Django and PostgreSQL. It allows users to log in, manage their income and expenses, filter entries by category and date, and view their real-time financial balance. The goal is to provide users with a simple yet powerful tool to gain control over their personal finances.

## ðŸ“– Project Story

This application was developed as part of the **Code Institute Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development**, fulfilling the criteria for the **Data-Centric Web Development Milestone Project (Project 3)**.

Inspired by the need for a clean and focused money management app, Wallet Tracker gives users full CRUD functionality with secure authentication, clean UI, and dynamic balance calculations. The application is fully responsive and suitable for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. 

The app demonstrates practical usage of Django, models, forms, user authentication, filtered queries, and PostgreSQL integration. It was designed and built step-by-step with Git version control, Agile Kanban planning, Heroku deployment, and detailed testing.
