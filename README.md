The goal is to provide users with a simple yet powerful tool to gain control over their personal finances.

## ðŸ“– Project Story

This application was developed as part of the **Code Institute Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development**, fulfilling the criteria for the **Data-Centric Web Development Milestone Project (Project 3)**.

Inspired by the need for a clean and focused money management app, Wallet Tracker gives users full CRUD functionality with secure authentication, clean UI, and dynamic balance calculations. The application is fully responsive and suitable for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. 

The app demonstrates practical usage of Django, models, forms, user authentication, filtered queries, and PostgreSQL integration. It was designed and built step-by-step with Git version control, Agile Kanban planning, Heroku deployment, and detailed testing.

# User Experience Design

## The Strategy Plane

### Site Goals

The Wallet Tracker ðŸ’¸ app is designed to help users manage their personal finances in a simple and effective way. The core focus is to allow users to:

- Edit or delete existing entries as their records change.
- View totals and monitor how much theyâ€™re spending or earning.
- Navigate the platform easily on mobile, tablet, or desktop.
- Use the app safely with user authentication and protected data.
- Have full CRUD functionality over income and expenses.

The app also focuses on a clean, accessible user interface and fully responsive design.

### Agile Planning

Agile methodology was used throughout the development of this project using GitHub Projects. Each user story was planned and executed in small, manageable tasks to ensure continuous progress.

User stories were written to capture the goals from the userâ€™s perspective and each included clear **Acceptance Criteria** to define when a task is complete. These user stories can be viewed on the [Wallet Tracker GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/USERNAME/wallet_tracker/projects/1).

- **Story 8: Write a professional README file**
  - *As a developer I can create a detailed README.md so that users and assessors understand the purpose, usage, and structure of the project.*
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** README includes project overview, features, and UX considerations, technologies used, setup instructions, testing, and deployment are documented, credits and licensing information are clearly listed and Markdown formatting is consistent and professional.

- **Story 9: Perform manual testing on the app**
