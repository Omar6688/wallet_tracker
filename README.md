## ðŸ“– Project Story

This application was developed as part of the **Code Institute Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development**, fulfilling the criteria for the **Data-Centric Web Development Milestone Project (Project 3)**.

Inspired by the need for a clean and focused money management app, Wallet Tracker gives users full CRUD functionality with secure authentication, clean UI, and dynamic balance calculations.

The app demonstrates practical usage of Django, models, forms, user authentication, filtered queries, and PostgreSQL integration. It was designed and built step-by-step with Git version control, Agile Kanban planning, Heroku deployment, and detailed testing.
